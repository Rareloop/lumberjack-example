# Lumberjack
A framework for making WordPress theme development more sane & easier to maintain.

Written & maintained by the team at [Rareloop](https://www.rareloop.com).

## Features
- Dependency Injection Container (PSR11)
- Configuration
- Post Types
- Actions & Filters

The framework has been designed to be as un-intrusive as possible and you're free to use as little or as much of it as you'd like.

## Requirements
- PHP >=7.0
- Installation via Composer (e.g. Bedrock)

## Installing
Download this theme to your Composer powered WordPress setup and then install the core framework dependency:

```shell
composer require rareloop/lumberjack-core
```

## Dependency Injection Container
Lumberjack features a PSR11 compatible container, powered by the popular open source [PHPDI](http://php-di.org). If this is a new term for you checkout this [great intro](http://php-di.org/doc/understanding-di.html) and don't worry, you don't have to make use of it if you don't want to.

## Accessing the container
In the default Lumberjack `functions.php` you'll find the following code:

```php
$app = new Application(__DIR__);
```

This creates the Application and the `$app` variable becomes your reference to the container.

### Setting entries in the container
To add something to the container you simply call `bind()`, e.g.:

```php
$app->bind('foo', 'bar');
```

### Retrieving entries from the container
To retrieve an entry from the container you can use `get()`, e.g.:

```php
$foo = $app->get('foo');
```

### Use the container to create an object
You can use the container to create an object from any class that your application can autoload using `make()`, e.g.:

```php
$comment = $app->make('\MyNamespace\Comment');
```

When creating an object using `make`, all the dependencies required by it's `__construct()` function will be automatically resolved from the container using type hinting. If your object requires additional parameters that can not resolved by type hinting you can pass them as a second param, e.g.:

```php
namespace MyNamespace;

class Comment
{
  public function __construct(ClassInContainer $resolvable, $param1, $param2) {}
}

...

$comment = $app->make('\MyNamespace\Comment', [
  'param1' => 123,
  'param2' => 'abc',
]);
```

### Set concrete implementations for interfaces
You can also tell the container what concrete class to use when resolving a certain type hinted interface. This allows you to write your app code against contracts and then use the container to switch in the correct implementation at runtime.

```php
namespace MyNamespace;

interface PaymentGateway {}

class StripePaymentGateway implements PaymentGateway{}

$app->set('\MyNamespace\PaymentGateway', '\MyNamespace\StripePaymentGateway');

$gateway = $app->make('\MyNamespace\PaymentGateway');
// $gateway is instance of '\MyNamespace\StripePaymentGateway'
```

## Router
The Lumberjack Router is based on the standalone [Rareloop Router](https://github.com/Rareloop/router) but utilised a Facade to make setup and access simpler.

Note: Route closures and controller functions are automatically dependency injected from the container.

### HTTP Request/Response Messages
### Creating Routes

#### Map

Creating a route is done using the `map` function:

```php
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Facades\Router;

// Creates a route that matches the uri `/posts/list` both GET
// and POST requests.
Router::map(['GET', 'POST'], 'posts/list', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});
```

`map()` takes 3 parameters:

- `methods` (array): list of matching request methods, valid values:
    + `GET`
    + `POST`
    + `PUT`
    + `PATCH`
    + `DELETE`
    + `OPTIONS`
- `uri` (string): The URI to match against
- `action`  (function|string): Either a closure or a Controller string

#### Route Parameters
Parameters can be defined on routes using the `{keyName}` syntax. When a route matches that contains parameters, an instance of the `RouteParams` object is passed to the action.

```php
Router::map(['GET'], 'posts/{id}', function(RouteParams $params) {
    return $params->id;
});
```

#### Named Routes
Routes can be named so that their URL can be generated programatically:

```php
Router::map(['GET'], 'posts/all', function () {})->name('posts.index');

$url = Router::url('posts.index');
```

If the route requires parameters you can be pass an associative array as a second parameter:

```php
Router::map(['GET'], 'posts/{id}', function () {})->name('posts.show');

$url = Router::url('posts.show', ['id' => 123]);
```

#### HTTP Verb Shortcuts
Typically you only need to allow one HTTP verb for a route, for these cases the following shortcuts can be used:

```php
Router::get('test/route', function () {});
Router::post('test/route', function () {});
Router::put('test/route', function () {});
Router::patch('test/route', function () {});
Router::delete('test/route', function () {});
Router::options('test/route', function () {});
```

### Creating Groups
It is common to group similar routes behind a common prefix. This can be achieved using Route Groups:

```php
Router::group('prefix', function ($group) {
    $group->map(['GET'], 'route1', function () {}); // `/prefix/route1`
    $group->map(['GET'], 'route2', function () {}); // `/prefix/route2ยง`
});
```

### Middleware

#### Route based middleware
#### Global middleware

## Controllers

### WordPress Controllers
TODO

### Route Controllers
If you'd rather use a class to group related route actions together you can pass a Controller String to `map()` instead of a closure. The string takes the format `{name of class}@{name of method}`. It is important that you use the complete namespace with the class name.

Example:

```php
// TestController.php
namespace \MyNamespace;

class TestController
{
    public function testMethod()
    {
        return 'Hello World';
    }
}

// routes.php
Router::map(['GET'], 'route/uri', '\MyNamespace\TestController@testMethod');
```

## Facades
Lumberjack uses the [Blast Facades](https://github.com/phpthinktank/blast-facades) library.

### Creating a Facade
Facades provide a simple static API to an object that has been registered into the container. For example to setup a facade you would first use a Service Provider to register an instance of your class into the container:

```php
namespace Rareloop\Lumberjack\Providers;

use Monolog\Logger;
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Application;

class LogServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        // Create object instance and bind into container
        $this->app->bind('logger', new Logger('app'));
    }
}
```

Then create a Facade subclass and tell it which key to use to retrieve your class instance:

```php
<?php

namespace Rareloop\Lumberjack\Facades;

use Blast\Facades\AbstractFacade;

class Log extends AbstractFacade
{
    protected static function accessor()
    {
        return 'logger';
    }
}
```
